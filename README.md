# My first website

Hey guys, what up!

 So, this is my first total front-end website made by myself and I hope you don't care about my code... It's just a project where I do learn about coding,
 and to be more specific, learn about HTML, CSS and JavaScript. After this, I'll try to take some Angular and API classes, wish me luck! <3
